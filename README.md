[01:02.60] Tonight I wanna see it in your eyes
[01:09.76] Feel the tension
[01:12.91] There's something that drives me wild
[01:17.28] And tonight I wanna make it all come true
[01:24.43] 'Cause girl, you were made for me
[01:28.39] And girl, I was made for you
[01:42.39] 
[01:33.61] I was made for lovin' you, baby
[01:37.35] You were made for lovin' me (lovin' me)
[01:41.02] I can't get enough of you, baby
[01:45.32] You get enough of me?
[01:48.36] I was made for lovin' you, baby
[01:52.17] And you were made for lovin' me
[01:56.45] I can give it all to you, baby
[02:00.41] Can you give it all to me?
[02:13.41]
